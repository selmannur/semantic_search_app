## Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:selmannur/semantic_search_app.git
```

Once cloned, make sure you are in the root folder (where `package.json` is) and install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You are now ready to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once dev server is running, you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and see the app.
